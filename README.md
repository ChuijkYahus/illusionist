# Illusionist

An official add-on for [Trickster](https://github.com/enjarai/trickster) which re-adds the Shadow Ploy and Revelation Ploy which are no longer present in Trickster 2.0.0-beta.1 and onward. These ploys exist to interact with shadow blocks, which are, quite simply, a method of disguising a block as any other. Shadow blocks were removed from the main Trickster mod due to issues regarding Sodium support; as such, this add-on currently breaks with most versions of Sodium. However, since version 2.0 of Illusionist, Sodium versions 0.6.0 to 0.6.9 are supported.
